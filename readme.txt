****************************************  Version Log  ****************************************
***********************************************************************************************

v1.1 - User interface, touch control, and items work perfectly. Boss needs to move more, and
       collision detection of obstacles needs to be improved.
       
v1.2 - Fixed some minor logical mistakes Added Background in each level. Improved Boss's AI of
       movement and the collision detection of blocks. However, there are still some minor 
       flaws in collision detection. Link cannot walk along the wall smoothly.

v1.3 - Final version of this project.
       Everything works. Fixed collision detection, logic of gate locker, and some designing.

Hints: It's easier to kill the Boss from the back, and Boss recovers its own HP gradually.
       Potion can only be used once, and doesn't recover over max health.
       Boss is paralyzed for a short period of time when Boss or Link is attacked.

Link starts the game with level-1 and use the gate to move on to the next level after finishing
the objective in each level. The boss does not look over his back, so use it as an advantage.
However, colliding with the boss might still cause some damage to Link.
